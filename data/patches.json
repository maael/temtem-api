        "We’ve made a lot of changes to Dojo Wars! Welcome to Dojo Wars v2:Dojo Wars will now happen only once per month, on the week that contains the last Sunday of that month.The period when clubs can subscribe to a Dojo War is one week instead one day. It’ll be the whole week before Dojo Wars commence.👥Dojo Wars finals will now require 9 players instead of 11 players.👥Players will now earn individual rewards, on top of Club rewards, for each match won during any given Dojo War. The further they progress into a Dojo War, the better their individual rewards will be. These rewards include Feathers, Hotfixes, ETCs or even Novas.👥The Dojo War system will now prioritize not matching two people again if they’ve just battled each other, even over the fact that they have the same amount of wins/losses.Clubs will be penalized if they sign up for a Dojo War but don’t attend it. Pansuns will be deducted from their Club Vault, with the possibility of going into the negative. Clubs with a negative Pansun sum in their Vault cannot sign up for Dojo Wars.👥The previous King of the Hill system that allowed current regents to only fight in the finals has been discarded. Regents will have to fight for the Dojo again from 0, like everyone else.👥Instead of having a set schedule for each round, rounds will now start 5 minutes after the previous round’s last match ended. This will make the pace of DW quicker.👥There will now be a Squad lock. It’s currently not working correctly due to a bug, but it’s in place all the same. The team you choose for the first match of a round will be the Squad you use for the entire duration of that round. There is a chance that you might be prompted to select a Squad after the first round, but regardless of which Squad you pick at this point, you will continue to use the Squad you locked in at the beginning of that round.",

Seeing Tems and defeating them or running from them will still count as having seen them, do keep this in mind for your playthrough!Randomlocke Mode: Same rules as the Nuzlocke mode, but with randomized Tems, move sets and items.Speedrun Mode: You must complete the story in as little time as possible.

        "Ranked v2 has been implemented.Ranked will now be determined by Seasons, the same ones that determine the Tamer Pass.TMR has been hidden. You will instead see a new system of ranks and leagues: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond and the Legend rank.Bronze, Silver, Gold and Diamond ranks also have 3 sub-ranks each (called divisions), while Legend will have a public leaderboard where you’ll see your position compared to other Legend players.Even though TMR is now hidden, internally the system still uses it. We have plans to make this data available via the API.In order to enter a new rank, players must reach the base TMR set for that rank. However, a rank can only be lost by losing two consecutive matches and reaching the threshold for the previous rank TMR.These ranks are calculated at the beginning of each season, and the idea is to calculate them based on the current population TMR spread.Rewards per match are now based on your current rank, and overall have been buffed from what they were before this patch.Seasonal rewards will now start being granted at the end of each season. These are a title that displays the highest rank you achieved, a seal for each rank you achieved, and a banner for each rank you achieved. These rewards will be different each season and will remain exclusive to each ranked season.The TMR lost when losing a ranked match will now be calculated with the max value between your current TMR and the TMR of your rival. This effectively means that losing against someone worse than you won’t penalize you as much as it did before.Also, the factor at which TMR gains and loses are calculated has been incremented, meaning matches will give (and subtract) more TMR in general. This will allow to have a bigger TMR spread along the leaderboard.We’ve reduced the TMR multiplier in placement matches so they are now less decisive.We’ve made some improvements to the matchmaking timings in order to reduce them when there is not a good opponent available. It will now match faster against worse or better opponents. The idea behind this is that is better to fight against someone non-optimal that not fight at all (or having to wait 20 minutes) and since TMR loses are now capped, it shouldn’t be as punishing as before.TMR decay will now happen. Each week (at the weekly activity reset), Diamond and Legend players that have been inactive for the past week will get their TMR decayed. In order to calculate the TMR lost, the system will simulate a lost match against yourself and the value will be multiplied by 2. A notification will be sent to each user that has had their TMR decayed.Tournaments will now use the player’s max TMR of the season to calculate the appropriate Tournament league, instead of the current TMR.We’ve included a fixed set of daily and weekly challenges that will grant further rewards to active ladder players.",

        "This patch introduces the new 8-stage system.Currently, there is a maximum of 5 stages that can give you up to +250% or -71% in a certain stat except for SPD. Each +1 increases each stat by 50%, and decreases it by a variable number (read more here to know the specifics). The maximum of 250%, when reached, can be very oppressive and too much of an advantage. Since each level up was done in steps of 50%, it was difficult to balance and tweak accurately and precisely, and we believed a middle point might be the key. Because of this, and after reading several community suggestions talking about a similar solution, we thought that an 8-stage system, one of the many possible reworks for the stages, would open the chance to a better balancing. We consulted our community on some specifics, and the resulting change affects all Techniques, Traits and Gears that increase or decrease stages in the game.This means Stages can now reach +8 and -8 instead of +5 and -5. A +8 situation will mean an increase of 200%, and a -8 situation will be a 66% decrease, as opposed to the previous maximum 250% increase and 71% decrease.All stats now follow the same pattern the Speed value, that was originally the odd one out, was following. This means SPD now shares the same formula, and can be increased up to 200%. All stats work in the same way now.Techniques up until now could only increase or decrease two stages of a specific stat. With this change, Techniques can now increase or decrease up to 4 stages of a specific stat.Like with the Stamina change in the past, we’ve listed all the specific changes to each Technique, Trait and Gear here, so all of you who are interested can check them out without turning these patch notes into a bible.",

You already know Coward’s Cloak; this one is similar, but affects the whole squad instead of just one Temtem. Once obtained, you can activate or deactivate the Coward’s Blanket any time you wish.Learning Aid: While this consumable item is active, the experience points you earn in a battle are multiplied by two. We know that leveling up in Temtem is not in its brightest spot right now, so we hope that this item, and the additional change on untamed experience, will help improve the situation a bit. While this item is currently locked behind certain loot pools, we plan to add easier access to this item in the future with the arrival of the endgame island.👥TemSpotter: While this consumable item is active, untamed Tems will display a special icon on their combat UI if they have one or more Stats with 49 or 50 SVs. This community suggested item should speed up and facilitate the hunt of good specimens for breeding.👥Ignoramus Cloak: A new Gear item that will prevent a Temtem from receiving Experience Points or TVs from a battle. Another community-suggested item!👥Fruit Smoothies: These new treats will increase or remove 50 TVs of a Stat. Smoothies are so far the most cost-efficient way of training Temtem TVs, and they can be purchased at any time from the new fruit vendor located in Arbury.👥Spirits’ Favor: And the last community suggested item of the batch, Spirit’s Favor provides one free entry to any Mythical Lair. They can currently drop from Wishing Wells, and they’ll help with running lairs in a more cost-efficient way.X-Incubator and Y-Incubator Gender Boost Tickets: These items increase the likelihood of the Gender ratios by 50% on any Temtem egg being opened in an Incubator. To give you an example: if you were to breed a Ganki, and used an X-Incubator Ticket on the egg, the offspring would have a 75% chance of being a female, instead of its usual 50%. If you were to breed Oree and used a Y-Incubator Ticket on the offspring, it would have a 37.5% of being a male, instead of its usual 25%.",
