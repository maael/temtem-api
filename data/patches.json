        "We have tweaked the idle battle cameras following the feedback provided by the community:In order to reduce motion sickness in some players, we’ve slowed all camera movement to 1/3 of its original movement speed.They will also start after 12 seconds of inactivity, as opposed to the previous 5 seconds of threshold. This will make them way less prevalent.In the specific case of Koish fishing, we’ve removed most of the camera angles so that only cameras that focus on the Koish patterns appear. We have also developed some new cameras for this activity in particular that will make identifying the patterns and colors easier.We know idle cameras have caused issues to some our players. Before we go through with disabling them, which would imply we stop receiving feedback and iterating on the feature, we’d like to give these changes a go to improve the main problems the cameras had. We believe the idle cameras add variety and richness to the game, so we’d rather polish them until everyone is happy than disable them without giving them a chance to be good.",

You will instead see a new system of ranks and leagues: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond and the Legend rank.Bronze, Silver, Gold and Diamond ranks also have 3 sub-ranks each (called divisions), while Legend will have a public leaderboard where you’ll see your position compared to other Legend players.Even though TMR is now hidden, internally the system still uses it. We have plans to make this data available via the API.In order to enter a new rank, players must reach the base TMR set for that rank. However, a rank can only be lost by losing two consecutive matches and reaching the threshold for the previous rank TMR.These ranks are calculated at the beginning of each season, and the idea is to calculate them based on the current population TMR spread.Rewards per match are now based on your current rank, and overall have been buffed from what they were before this patch.Seasonal rewards will now start being granted at the end of each season. These are a title that displays the highest rank you achieved, a seal for each rank you achieved, and a banner for each rank you achieved. These rewards will be different each season and will remain exclusive to each ranked season.The TMR lost when losing a ranked match will now be calculated with the max value between your current TMR and the TMR of your rival. This effectively means that losing against someone worse than you won’t penalize you as much as it did before.Also, the factor at which TMR gains and loses are calculated has been incremented, meaning matches will give (and subtract) more TMR in general. This will allow to have a bigger TMR spread along the leaderboard.We’ve reduced the TMR multiplier in placement matches so they are now less decisive.We’ve made some improvements to the matchmaking timings in order to reduce them when there is not a good opponent available. It will now match faster against worse or better opponents. The idea behind this is that is better to fight against someone non-optimal that not fight at all (or having to wait 20 minutes) and since TMR loses are now capped, it shouldn’t be as punishing as before.TMR decay will now happen. Each week (at the weekly activity reset), Diamond and Legend players that have been inactive for the past week will get their TMR decayed. In order to calculate the TMR lost, the system will simulate a lost match against yourself and the value will be multiplied by 2. A notification will be sent to each user that has had their TMR decayed.Tournaments will now use the player’s max TMR of the season to calculate the appropriate Tournament league, instead of the current TMR.We’ve included a fixed set of daily and weekly challenges that will grant further rewards to active ladder players.",

        "This patch introduces the new 8-stage system.Currently, there is a maximum of 5 stages that can give you up to +250% or -71% in a certain stat except for SPD. Each +1 increases each stat by 50%, and decreases it by a variable number (read more here to know the specifics). The maximum of 250%, when reached, can be very oppressive and too much of an advantage. Since each level up was done in steps of 50%, it was difficult to balance and tweak accurately and precisely, and we believed a middle point might be the key. Because of this, and after reading several community suggestions talking about a similar solution, we thought that an 8-stage system, one of the many possible reworks for the stages, would open the chance to a better balancing. We consulted our community on some specifics, and the resulting change affects all Techniques, Traits and Gears that increase or decrease stages in the game.This means Stages can now reach +8 and -8 instead of +5 and -5. A +8 situation will mean an increase of 200%, and a -8 situation will be a 66% decrease, as opposed to the previous maximum 250% increase and 71% decrease.All stats now follow the same pattern the Speed value, that was originally the odd one out, was following. This means SPD now shares the same formula, and can be increased up to 200%. All stats work in the same way now.Techniques up until now could only increase or decrease two stages of a specific stat. With this change, Techniques can now increase or decrease up to 4 stages of a specific stat.Like with the Stamina change in the past, we’ve listed all the specific changes to each Technique, Trait and Gear here, so all of you who are interested can check them out without turning these patch notes into a bible.",

Once obtained, you can activate or deactivate the Coward’s Blanket any time you wish.Learning Aid: While this consumable item is active, the experience points you earn in a battle are multiplied by two. We know that leveling up in Temtem is not in its brightest spot right now, so we hope that this item, and the additional change on untamed experience, will help improve the situation a bit. While this item is currently locked behind certain loot pools, we plan to add easier access to this item in the future with the arrival of the endgame island.👥TemSpotter: While this consumable item is active, untamed Tems will display a special icon on their combat UI if they have one or more Stats with 49 or 50 SVs. This community suggested item should speed up and facilitate the hunt of good specimens for breeding.👥Ignoramus Cloak: A new Gear item that will prevent a Temtem from receiving Experience Points or TVs from a battle. Another community-suggested item!👥Fruit Smoothies: These new treats will increase or remove 50 TVs of a Stat. Smoothies are so far the most cost-efficient way of training Temtem TVs, and they can be purchased at any time from the new fruit vendor located in Arbury.👥Spirits’ Favor: And the last community suggested item of the batch, Spirit’s Favor provides one free entry to any Mythical Lair. They can currently drop from Wishing Wells, and they’ll help with running lairs in a more cost-efficient way.X-Incubator and Y-Incubator Gender Boost Tickets: These items increase the likelihood of the Gender ratios by 50% on any Temtem egg being opened in an Incubator. To give you an example: if you were to breed a Ganki, and used an X-Incubator Ticket on the egg, the offspring would have a 75% chance of being a female, instead of its usual 50%. If you were to breed Oree and used a Y-Incubator Ticket on the offspring, it would have a 37.5% of being a male, instead of its usual 25%.",
